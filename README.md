# CS5513_Project

WebUI is just the UI project. in VS, make sure this is the default startup project. it should be by default but if not then right click "WebUI" then "Set as startup project"

AlgorithmLibrary is where a lot of our development will be. This is essentially the "middleware" of the project, it will be simulating the data base algorithms we implement
